# Prerequisites

Before developing OpenMRS Microfrontends, you should be familiar with the following technologies.

## Javascript

Knowing Javascript is prerequisite to everything else. Consider 
[Introduction to Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).

## JavaScript Tooling

You'll want to understand the basics of [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/),
including the command-line interface (run `npm help`), [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json), [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx), and know what [node](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/) is.

If the repository you're looking at has a `yarn.lock` file, then it uses `yarn`,
and you'll want to read the [Yarn docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started).
Otherwise it uses `npm`. Yarn and npm are exclusive of each other within a repository.
    
If the repository you're looking at has a `packages` directory at the top level,
then it is a "monorepo" and is using Lerna, and you'll want to read the
[Lerna docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#readme).
Otherwise, you don't have to worry about Lerna.

## React

You should know everything from [React Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html),
and sections 1-5 of [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

If you're new to React, please work through a tutorial in addition to reading
the above documentation. The
[Official React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
and the video-based [React JS Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8)
are good ones.

Take your time. This is a lot of material. The better you understand it, the more
easily you will be able to develop high-quality microfrontends (and other React applications).

## TypeScript

You can get started with Typescript pretty quickly. If you're new to it,
please read [TypeScript in 5 Minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).

## Git

It is imperative that you keep your code in a version control system. OpenMRS uses
[Git](https://git-scm.com/). You should know the basics of using git and GitHub.
The website [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) and the video
[Git and GitHub for Begineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
are excellent resources.
