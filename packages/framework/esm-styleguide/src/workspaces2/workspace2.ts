 * Attempts to launch the specified workspace with the given workspace props. This also implicitly opens

 *
 * When calling `launchWorkspace2`, we need to also pass in the workspace props. While not required,
 * we can also pass in the window props (shared by other workspaces in the window) and the group props
 * (shared by all windows and their workspaces). Omitting the window props or the group props¹ means the caller
 * explicitly does not care what the current window props and group props are, and that they may be set
 * by other actions (like calling `launchWorkspace2` on a different workspace with those props passed in)
 * at a later time.
 *
 * If there is already an opened workspace group, and it's not the group the workspace belongs to
 * or has incompatible² group props, then we prompt the user to close the group (and its windows and their workspaces).
 * On user confirm, the existing opened group is closed and the new workspace, along with its window and its group,
 * is opened.
 *
 * If the window is already opened, but with incompatible window props, we prompt the user to close
 * the window (and all its opened workspaces), and reopen the window with (only) the newly requested workspace.
 *
 * If the workspace is already opened, but with incompatible workspace props, we also prompt the user to close
 * the **window** (and all its opened workspaces), and reopen the window with (only) the newly requested workspace.
 * This is true regardless of whether the already opened workspace has any child workspaces.
 *
 * Note that calling this function *never* results in creating a child workspace in the affected window.
 * To do so, we need to call `launchChildWorkspace` instead.
 *
 * [¹] Omitting window or group props is useful for workspaces that don't have ties to the window or group "context" (props).
 * For example, in the patient chart, the visit notes / clinical forms / order basket action menu button all share
 * a "group context" of the current visit. However, the "patient list" action menu button does not need to share that group
 * context, so opening that workspace should not need to cause other workspaces / windows / groups to potentially close.
 * The "patient search" workspace in the queues and ward apps is another example.
 *
 * [²] 2 sets of props are compatible if either one is nullish, or if they are shallow equal.
