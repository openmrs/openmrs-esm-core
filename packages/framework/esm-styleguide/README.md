# openmrs-esm-styleguide

The styleguide for OpenMRS.

All our frontend UI development is based on [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/). 

Please see [our latest styleguide here](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5f7223cfda10f94d67cec6d0/styleguide/components/). 
Nuanced overrides of Carbon are specifically highlighted in [/src/carbon-overrides.css](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-core/blob/master/packages/esm-styleguide/src/carbon-overrides.css).
(Note: You may need to request access to our Zeplin project; simply contact a member of the OpenMRS Microfrontend Squad or post in #microfrontends to request access.)
