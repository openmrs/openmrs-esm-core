# Implementer Tools App

## Overview

The **Implementer Tools App** is an vital component of the OpenMRS 3.0 ecosystem, designed to empower implementers with the ability to manage configurations and easily access administrative insights. This is achieved by providing a user-friendly interface, it facilitates customization and optimization of the OpenMRS frontend to meet specific  needs of implementation, thereby enhancing the flexibility and user-centricity of the platform. It is part of the
[Extension System](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-rfc-frontend/pull/27/files).

## Installation & Setup

To integrate the Implementer Tools App into your OpenMRS environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-core.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the App Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd openmrs-esm-core/packages/apps/esm-implementer-tools-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, execute:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build the App:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Deploy the App:**

   Copy the built files to your OpenMRS frontend directory or serve them using a static file server as per your deployment strategy.

6. **Register the App in OpenMRS:**

   Add the app's entry point to your OpenMRS frontend configuration to ensure it's recognized and loaded appropriately.

## Usage Guide

Once installed, the Implementer Tools App can be accessed through the OpenMRS frontend interface. Key functionalities include:

- **Configuration Management:**

  Navigate to the "Configuration" section to view and modify system settings. This allows for real-time customization of various parameters to tailor the system to your needs.

- **Administrative Insights:**

  The "System Info" section provides vital information about the application's status, version, and performance metrics, aiding in effective system monitoring and maintenance.

- **Module Management:**

  Under "Modules," you can enable or disable specific modules, ensuring that only the necessary functionalities are active, thereby optimizing system performance.

## Configuration Options

The Implementer Tools App offers a range of configurable parameters. Below is a table summarizing key configurations:

| Parameter               | Type    | Default Value | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `configSource`          | String  | `default`     | Specifies the source of configuration files (e.g., `default`, `custom`).                    |
| `enableDebugMode`       | Boolean | `false`       | Toggles debug mode for detailed logging and troubleshooting.                                |
| `allowedModules`        | Array   | `[]`          | Lists modules permitted to run within the application.                                      |
| `theme`                 | String  | `light`       | Sets the visual theme of the application (`light` or `dark`).                               |
| `autoUpdateInterval`    | Number  | `60`          | Defines the interval (in minutes) for automatic checks for updates.                         |

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

### The Implementer Tools App isn't appearing in the OpenMRS frontend. What should I do?

- **Solution:** Verify that the app is correctly registered in the OpenMRS frontend configuration. Ensure that the deployment path is accurate and that the application has been built without errors.

### How can I reset configurations to their default values?

- **Solution:** Navigate to the "Configuration" section within the app and select the option to reset to default settings. Alternatively, manually replace the current configuration file with the default one from the original installation.

### I'm encountering permission errors when accessing certain features. How can this be resolved?

- **Solution:** Ensure that your user account has the necessary roles and permissions assigned. Review the OpenMRS user management settings to grant appropriate access levels.

### The application is running slower than expected. What steps can I take to improve performance?

- **Solution:** Disable any unnecessary modules through the "Module Management" section. Additionally, check the system resources and optimize configurations such as memory allocation and database indexing.

### Where can I find logs for debugging purposes?

- **Solution:** Logs are typically located in the `logs` directory of your OpenMRS installation. Ensure that logging is enabled in the configuration settings.
